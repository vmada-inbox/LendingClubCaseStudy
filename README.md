# Project Name
> You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company 

The data given below contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

In this case study, you will use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.

## General Information
- Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 

## Conclusions
- Loans applied for 60 months term default more often than 30 months.
 High grade loans don’t default much, hence the grading system is
robust.
 Loans applied for small business and renewable energy default more
often. Need to take sufficient precaution.
 Loans applied from few states like NV, AK and TN have high Default Rate.
Need to take some actionable steps to avoid such incidents in future.
 Loans applied for very high amount tend to incur more interest rates
and hence higher default rate.
 Need to scrutinize the process while approving loans to borrowers with
derogatory public records, bankruptcy records, high credit inquiries,
records of delinquencies and high rate of revolving credit line utilisation
